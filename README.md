# MEDICARE-DRUG-ANALYSIS

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Medicare drug spending from 2019 to 2023, using publicly available CMS datasets. The goal is to understand where Medicare’s drug dollars are going, identify cost drivers, and uncover trends in pricing, utilization, and manufacturer concentration.

## Key questions explored:

* Size: What is total spend by year and drug? By manufacturer?
* Price: How is average spend per dose unit changing? Per claim? Per beneficiary?
* Mix: What is the brand vs. generic share and how is it shifting?
* Outliers: Which products trigger the outlier flag and why?
* Growth: Which drugs have the highest 2019–2023 CAGR in price-per-dose?

Part D spending is significantly higher than Part B, accounting for the bulk of Medicare drug expenditures.

Both programs show year-over-year growth, with Part D rising from roughly $180B in 2019 to more than $275B in 2023.

Part B spending grows more modestly—from about $38B to $50B—but still shows a clear upward trend.
